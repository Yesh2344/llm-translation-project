# LLM Translation Project

This project aims to enhance low-resource machine translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). We compare traditional Neural Machine Translation (NMT) approaches with LLM-based methods for both high-resource (English-French) and low-resource (English-Swahili) language pairs.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets
- `models/`: Stores trained models
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, model training, and evaluation
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the project

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv llm_translation_env`
3. Activate the virtual environment `llm_translation_env\Scripts\activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
